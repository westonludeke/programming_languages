This project is a brief web page that provides information about a few different programming languages. It includes descriptions of each language, along with a "Show More" button that expands the description text and a "Show Less" button that collapses the description text. 

The web page is styled with a light blue and pink gradient background, with a white box containing the descriptions of the different languages. The design is responsive and adjusts to smaller screens. The programming language descriptions include Ruby, JavaScript, Lisp, Python, and Go. 

The page is written in HTML and CSS, with Javascript event listeners for the "Show More" and "Show Less" buttons. The project was built as part of [Launch School's](https://launchschool.com) JS230 course.
