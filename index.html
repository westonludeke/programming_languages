        <h2>Ruby</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.
          It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan. According to
          its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports
          multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It
          also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="description">
          JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.
          It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS,
          JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the
          majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for
          plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm
          language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

        <h2>Lisp</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history
          and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is
          the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is
          older, by one year. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over
          its history. Today, the best known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme.

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability and ease of use. It was first released in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and development of large-scale software applications. Python is used in a wide range of industries and applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and more.

        <h2>Go</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It was created to address some of the problems associated with large-scale software development, such as slow compile times, cumbersome syntax, and difficult dependency management. Go features a concise and expressive syntax, garbage collection, and a strong focus on concurrency and parallelism. It also includes features for low-level programming, such as memory management and pointer arithmetic, making it a suitable choice for systems programming. Go has gained popularity in recent years for its simplicity, ease of use, and ability to handle large-scale projects.
